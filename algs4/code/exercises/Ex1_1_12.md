# Ex 1.1.12

Prints 0..4 4..0;

Initially I thought 0..9, but let’s think about this.

The array gets reversed by the first for loop:

```java
int[10] { 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 }
```

Then the second for loop sets each item to be the item found by indexing into the array with its current item.
(Confused?)

So, if `a[0] == 9`, set `a[0] = a[a[9]]`.

But what happens at the half-way point (index 5), you end up looking up values that you’ve just set.

For instance, `a[4] = (a[a[4]] -> a[5])` but `a[5] = (a[a[5]] -> a[4])`.
