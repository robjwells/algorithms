# Ex 1.1.6

Incorrect first guess: “Prints the value of `f` 16 times, where `f` is 0 once and then 1 the other times.”

Prints the Fibonacci series. Reason for my error the first time is that `g` is set to 0 on the first loop,
but that just means that `0` is subtracted from `f` the next time, so `g` becomes 1. And so on.

Eg:

    (f, g), at the end of each loop
    (1, 0)
    (1, 1)
    (2, 1)
    (3, 2)
    (5, 3)
