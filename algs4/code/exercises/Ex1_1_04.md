# Ex 1.1.4

## A

```java
if (a > b) then c = 0;
```

`then` is not a Java keyword.

## B

```java
if a > b { c = 0; }
```

Java requires conditions to be surrounded by parentheses.

## C

```java
if (a > b) c = 0;
```

OK. Missing braces from around the statement is considered bad practice
(as it makes it much easier to make mistakes).

## D

```java
if (a > b) c = 0 else b = 0;
```

Originally I thought: “OK, as above. Missing braces makes it easier to introduce errors.”
But actually a semicolon is missing from after `c = 0`.
