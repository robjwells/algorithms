# Ex 1.1.18

## Part one

`mystery` computes multiplication recursively.

For the example call (3, 11):

a       | b       | return
-------:|--------:|--------
3       | 11      | f(6, 5) + 3
6       | 5       | f(12, 2) + 6
12      | 2       | f(24, 1)
24      | 1       | f(48, 0) + 24
48      | 0       | 0

If we sum the `+ x` parts of the recursive calls,
we find `mystery(3, 11) == 33`.

We were instead to call (3, 8):

a       | b       | return
-------:|---------|--------
3       | 8       | f(6, 4)
6       | 4       | f(12, 2)
12      | 2       | f(24, 1)
24      | 1       | f(48, 0) + 24
48      | 0       | 0

Where we see that, because the multiplier is a power of
two, and so always divides evenly, only the final case
returns an integer (ignoring the 0 base case).

## Part two

Were we to replace the addition with multiplication, and
the 0 base case with 1, we change `mystery` from
multiplication to exponentiation.

For instance, with the call (3, 7):

a       | b       | return
-------:|---------|--------
3       | 7       | f(9, 3) * 3
9       | 3       | f(81, 1) * 9
81      | 1       | f(6561, 0) * 81
6561    | 0       | 1

Or, $1 \times 81 \times 9 \times 3$, which equals 2,187, or $3^7$.

## Dead ends

I went down some dead ends before working out how this function worked.
The doubling/halving method threw me off â€” if it were the more typical
decrement-type recusive multiplication I think I would have spotted it
fairly quickly.

After getting the multiplication (only by trying out the code and working
backwards), I went down a dead end for the second part. This is because
I made a serious mistake when playing with the code, where I failed to
adapt the `a * 2` which I had used instead of `a + a` for the first part
(in a bid to clarify the code for myself) into `a * a`.

This exercise also appears in the Sedgewick/Wayne Introduction to
Programming book, and [there is a (brief) answer on the booksite][ans].
