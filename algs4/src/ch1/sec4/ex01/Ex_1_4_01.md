# Ex 1.4.1

If we have *n* integers and we choose our triple without replacement, then:

*   There are *n* choices for the first element.
*   There are *n - 1* choices for the second element.
*   There are *n - 2* choices for the third element.

Or, *n × (n - 1) × (n - 2)*.

For any three numbers, there are six possible orderings (*3!*).
However, for our purposes, we consider triples with identical
elements but a different order to be distinct.

Therefore, we have: *n × (n - 1) × (n - 2) ÷ 6*.

We can recognise this as an *n*-choose-*k* situation, with *k = 3*.
