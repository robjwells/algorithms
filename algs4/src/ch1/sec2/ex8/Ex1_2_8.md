# Ex 1.2.8

> Suppose that a[] and b[] are each integer arrays consisting of millions of integers. What does the follow code do? Is it reasonably efficient?

```java
    int[] t = a; a = b; b = t;
```

It swaps the two arrays over (so that the original `b` can be accessed through `a` etc).

The only operations performed are:

* Placing a reference to `a` in `t`
* Setting `a` to point to the reference of `b`
* Setting `b` to point to the reference of `a` (via `t`)

There’s no copying involved, so it doesn’t matter what the arrays contain.
