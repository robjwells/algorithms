# Exercise 1.3.46

## Question

> Prove that a permutation can be generated by a stack if and only if it has no
> forbidden triple (*a, b, c*) such that *a < b < c* with *c* first, *a* second,
> and *b* third (possibly with other intervening integers between *c* and *a*
> and between *a* and *b*).

The description originally (omitted here) refers back to the previous question,
in which we are dealing with increasing sequences of *N* integers, *0...N-1*.
This is crucial to the solution.

## Provided partial solution:

> Suppose that there is a forbidden triple of (*a, b, c*). Item *c* is popped
> before *a* and *b*, but *a* and *b* are pushed before *c*. Thus when *c* is
> pushed, both *a* and *b* are on the stack. Therefore *a* cannot be popped
> before *b*.

## Remaining solution:

When pushing integers *0...N-1* onto the stack, regardless of the sequence of
pops from the stack, smaller integers are always below larger integers.
Because stacks only the top element to be removed (popped), only the largest
element in the stack can be removed at any time.

Therefore, if *a < b*, *b* will have to be removed before *a* and so a forbidden
triple popped in the order *c, a, b* but with the natural ordering *a < b < c*
cannot be possible.
